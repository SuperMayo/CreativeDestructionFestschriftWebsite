            In 1992, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt published
            "A Model of Growth through Creative Destruction".
            To honor the 30th anniversary of this publication, Ufuk Akcigit and John Van Reenen are organizing a four-day zoom seminar,
            followed-up by a book edited at Harvard University Press on "The Economics of Creative Destruction".
            More than a hundred renowned economists will meet from June 9 to June 12 to present and exchange ideas about how the creative destruction framework offers a fresh lens to think about questions such as:

  tribute: >-
    This Festschrift conference, organized by Ufuk Akcigit and John Van Reenen,
    was initiated by Emmanuel Farhi, who passed away in July 2020.
    The opening session on June 9 will honor his memory.
    A beautiful mind and a genius economist,
    widely considered as the best macroeconomist of his generation,
    Emmanuel was also an outstanding human being who never failed to find time to listen to us and to provide advice and support.
    His great intelligence, his open-mindedness,
    his unbounded curiosity and his uncommon generosity, are sorely missed.
  subtexts:
    - We thank the whole team at the Farhi Innovation Lab at College de France for their dedicated involvement in this project.
    - This conference is organized with the financial support of Banque de France and LVMH. John Van Reenen also thanks the ESRC through the POID initiative.
